## üåü Project Overview

Please provide the following:

    If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tagline 
*Tagline:* PolkaVision  transforms English into Polkadot programs.
---
     A brief description of your project
#### *PolkaVision* is a comprehensive visual AI development tool that enables users to design, build, and deploy decentralized applications on Polkadot through an intuitive, drag-and-drop interface powered by artificial intelligence. It eliminates the steep learning curve typically associated with blockchain development by automatically generating Rust and ink! code from visual workflows and natural language instructions.

**Pain Points**
- Polkadot presents a steep learning curve for new developers
- There is a shortage of experienced developers within the Polkadot ecosystem
- Existing tools are often not user-friendly or accessible to newcomers


**Why it matters:**
- These challenges hinder the growth of the ecosystem
- Innovation is limited due to a small and specialized developer pool

---

    An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project
#### üí° Addressing the critical shortage of Polkadot developers and lowering barriers to entry that currently slow ecosystem growth and innovation.

Our motivation stems from firsthand experience at three different Polkadot hackathon events‚Äîas both participants and mentors‚Äîwhere we consistently observed two critical pain points:

1. **Time-Consuming Smart Contract Scaffolding:** Over 60% of hackathon teams spent more than 40% of their event time configuring basic ink! contract structures instead of focusing on innovation.

2. **Cognitive Overload:** New developers struggled to simultaneously master Rust, Substrate pallet design, and Polkadot's cross-chain architecture‚Äîa tripled learning curve.
   
PolkaVision directly addresses these hurdles through:
* **Hackathon-Optimized Templates:** Pre-built smart contract modules for common DeFi, NFT, and gaming use cases, with one-click customization.
* **Real-Time Parity:** Seamless synchronization between visual workflows and the generated ink! code, enabling rapid iteration during timed competitions.
* **Collision Detection:** AI-powered conflict resolution for cross-chain interactions‚Äîparticularly valuable when integrating multiple pallets under time constraints.

This toolchain is specifically designed to reduce the average smart contract initialization time from 8.2 hours to under 15 minutes, based on my hackathon experience‚Äîallowing developers to focus on unique value propositions rather than boilerplate implementation.

      Any PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

The PolkaVision concept aims to transform Polkadot development by providing a visual AI tool that converts natural language into functional code.

I was introduced to this concept at the Easy Polkadot London Hackathon 2025 on Saturday

**Polkadot Deployment Portal (PDP) Initiative**
The Polkadot Deployment Portal (PDP) represents another significant advancement aimed at improving the developer experience:
"The Polkadot Deployment Portal (PDP), launching soon, will revolutionize how you deploy on Polkadot. Anyone will be able to take advantage of the PDP's intuitive UI and capabilities, allowing you to configure, deploy, and manage a rollup with a few simple clicks."
[Polkadot Deployment Portal:]([https://grants.web3.foundation/applications/project_aurras_mvp_phase_1](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/forum/t/polkadot-deployment-portal-the-1-click-solution-for-polkadot/12176))

**Project Aurras** developed an MVP for a middleware solution that functions as both an event processor and a workflow orchestration platform:
"Aurras is a middleware that acts as an event processor and a low-code workflow orchestration platform. Aurras is being pitched as a next-generation system for enabling decentralized push notifications."

While not directly focused on visual programming, this MVP demonstrates the successful implementation of low-code workflow orchestration within the Polkadot ecosystem‚Äîhighlighting conceptual similarities with PolkaVision's visual workflow builder.

Although there is no direct precedent for a visual, AI-powered Polkadot development tool that fully matches PolkaVision's vision, several related initiatives underscore both the need for and technical feasibility of such a solution.

These existing PoCs and MVPs offer valuable insights for PolkaVision's development trajectory‚Äîparticularly in areas such as rapid prototyping, security considerations, and strategies for lowering the barrier to entry in blockchain development.

*Chainziz, Submap, DotAppstore**	"Visualization, analytics, and app directories that make it easier for developers and users to navigate and understand the ecosystem."

**Polkadot.js & Substrate** ‚Äî Core tools and frameworks that simplify interaction and development on Polkadot, including user-friendly interfaces and modular blockchain building blocks.
*Category: Tooling and development frameworks*

I used this to build EchoPay 2
      
### Drawing on what we learn from EchoPay 2
[EchoPay 2](https://github.com/YanniWu88/EchoPay-2/tree/master "EchoPay 2")

**EchoPay 2** An innovative payment platform concept that enables users to conduct secure, cross-chain transactions through voice commands. This repository contains the initial proof-of-concept implementation, focusing on the frontend interface, wallet connection, and voice input simulation.

Key takeaways include wallet connection, voice input simulation, and writing smart contracts in Rust. The wallet intergration mean we charge for AI credits.

### 1. User Model:

---
        What your project is not or will not provide or implement

What the Project Will Not Provide:

Excluded Features & Limitations
1. **Low-Level Programming Support**
‚ùå No assembly or manual Rust optimization
PolkaVision avoids exposing users to low-level Rust/ink! coding, memory management, or performance tweaking. It abstracts these details behind its visual interface and AI-generated code.

2. **Multi-Chain Compatibility**
‚ùå No support for non-Polkadot ecosystems
The tool is strictly focused on Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama. Cross-chain compatibility with Ethereum, Solana, or other ecosystems is outside its scope.

3. **Advanced Infrastructure Management**
‚ùå No direct control over collators, validators, or RPC nodes
PolkaVision relies on integrations like the Polkadot Deployment Portal (PDP) for infrastructure orchestration. It does not manage relay chain validators or coretime allocation directly.

4. **Custom Runtime Development**
‚ùå No manual runtime pallet configuration
Users cannot directly modify Substrate pallets or runtime logic. All runtime templates (e.g., OZ Generic/EVM) are pre-defined and managed via AI.

5. **On-Chain Governance Tools**
‚ùå No native governance dashboards
While PolkaVision generates governance-related modules (e.g., voting systems), it does not provide tools for managing on-chain treasury proposals or council elections.

6. **Financial Services**
‚ùå No built-in wallets or payment gateways
PolkaVision focuses on dApp development, not financial infrastructure. Users must integrate third-party wallets (e.g., Talisman, Polkadot.js).

7. **Manual Error Handling**
‚ùå No fine-grained exception control
The AI automatically handles common errors (e.g., transaction failures), avoiding low-level try/catch logic or manual rollback workflows.

8. **Legacy System Integration**
‚ùå No support for non-containerized environments
PolkaVision mandates Docker-based workflows and pre-configured environments. It does not support legacy systems or custom non-containerized setups.

9. **Native Mobile Development**
‚ùå No mobile SDKs or platform-specific tooling
The platform generates web-first code (React/TypeScript) and does not target iOS/Android native apps.

10. **Proprietary AI Models for Code Audits**
‚ùå No manual AI model training
Users cannot customize or retrain the underlying AI models (e.g., Llama3Instruct8B) used for code generation or security audits.

Philosophical Exclusions
**No "code-first" workflows:** PolkaVision prioritizes visual design over traditional coding, even for advanced users.

**No permissionless runtime modifications:** All deployments adhere to pre-vetted Polkadot runtime standards to ensure security.

**No community-driven template submissions:** TTemplates are curated internally to maintain quality and compatibility.

        If so, how is your project different?
How Polkavision Is Different
1. No-Code/Low-Code Development
Polkavision enables users to build and deploy on Polkadot without writing or understanding Rust‚Äîor even much code at all.
- Other platforms, like PDP, focus on simplifying deployment but often still require some technical configuration or scripting knowledge.

2. Unified Visual Interface
Polkavision offers a visual, drag-and-drop interface for designing parachains, smart contracts, and dApps.
- PDP and similar tools may provide step-by-step wizards or forms, but they do not offer a fully interactive visual builder.

3. End-to-End Workflow Integration
Polkavision covers the entire process‚Äîfrom design, deployment, and monitoring to upgrades‚Äîwithin a single platform.
- Other tools often focus on a single aspect (e.g., deployment or monitoring), requiring users to switch between multiple platforms.

4. Accessibility for Non-Technical Users
Polkavision is designed specifically for entrepreneurs, product managers, and non-developers, not just software engineers.
- Most alternatives are still developer-centric, assuming some familiarity with blockchain concepts or coding.

6. Plug-and-Play Modules
Polkavision provides a library of pre-built modules‚Äîgovernance, tokens, NFTs, and more‚Äîthat can be added with a click.
- Other platforms may require manual configuration or code customization to achieve similar functionality.

6. Real-Time Collaboration
Polkavision supports collaborative editing, so teams can work together in real time‚Äîsimilar to Google Docs, but for blockchain projects.
- Few, if any, competitors offer this level of real-time, multi-user collaboration.

- Need to look into hosting this on the cloud using Docker.
  
- **User Experience Design:**  
- Planning to build it like the ChatGPT UI, but with the main screen as an open canvas.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information

    Here you can add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application, such as:

    Work you have already done
    If there are any other teams who have already contributed to the project
    Other funding you may have applied for

We are aware of a similar project that has been built on Solana, so we are hoping to implement a drag-and-drop interface for this project as well. If we can link it with PDP and ensure it delivers the promised functionality, we would consider it 70% complete.
We would then move on to integrating it with an LLM, enabling voice input. 


  ## Team Expansion Plans

Team Expansion Plans:
Just found out about this grant on Saturday so I am in discussions with experienced developers‚Äî [Justin](https://github.com/ju3tin) may join the project, depending on their availability.

Also made a met [Jasmine](https://github.com/JasmineSJYThompson/) last week, and would love to work with her 

Relevant Experience:

Several members of our team, including myself, have personal experience working as freelancers and complete in hackathons and have encountered the exact challenges *PolkaVision* aims to solve. This gives us a unique, user-centered perspective that informs our product design and priorities.

We have also been active participants in the Polkadot ecosystem for over 3 year. Notably, we received a guarantee fund for our project EchoPay 2 at the EasyA London Hackathon 2024, plus winning 3 place in EasyA x Polkadot London Hackathon 2025. In addition, we have attended numerous workshops, webinars, and community events to deepen our knowledge and strengthen our connections within the ecosystem.

    Other funding you may have applied for
