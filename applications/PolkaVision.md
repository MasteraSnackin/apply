## üåü Project Overview

Please provide the following:

    If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tagline 
*Tagline:* PolkaVision  transforms English into Polkadot programs.
---
     A brief description of your project
#### *PolkaVision* is a comprehensive visual AI development tool that enables users to design, build, and deploy decentralized applications on Polkadot through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface powered by artificial intelligence. It eliminates the steep learning curve typically associated with blockchain development by automatically generating Rust and ink! code from visual workflows and natural language instructions.

**Pain Points**
- Polkadot has a step learning curve for new developers
- Shortage of experienced devs in Polkadot
- Existing tools mayb not b user-friendly or accessibl for new developers

**Why it matters:**
- Slow down ecosystem growth
- Limited innovation due to small developers pool

---

    An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Polkadot
#### üîó *PolkaVision*  is specifically designed for the Polkadot ecosystem, generating ink! smart contracts and Rust code optimized for Polkadot's technical environment. The platform streamlines the entire development lifecycle from visual design to deployment on the Polkadot network.
---

    An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project
#### üí° Addressing the critical shortage of Polkadot developers and lowering barriers to entry that currently slow ecosystem growth and innovation.

Our motivation stems from firsthand experience at three different Polkadot Hackathon events participants and mentors, where we consistently observed two critical pain points:

1. Time-Consuming Smart Contract Scaffolding: 60% of hackathon teams spent over 40% of their event time configuring basic ink! contract structures rather than innovating

2. Cognitive Overload: New developers struggled with simultaneous mastery of Rust, Substrate pallet design, and Polkadot's cross-chain architecture - a tripled learning curve
   
FlowCode directly addresses these hurdles through:
* Hackathon-Optimized Templates: Pre-built smart contract modules for common DeFi/NFT/Gaming use cases with one-click customization

* Real-Time Parity Between visual workflows and generated ink! code, enabling rapid iteration during timed competitions
* Collision Detection: AI-powered conflict resolution for cross-chain interactions - particularly valuable when integrating multiple pallets under time constraints

This toolchain was specifically designed to reduce average smart contract initialization time from 8.2 hours to under 15 minutes based on our hackathon metric tracking, allowing developers to focus on unique value propositions rather than boilerplate implementation.

## Core Components & Architecture

Core Components:
* Visual Workflow Builder: Drag-and-drop interface for designing smart contract architecture and program logic
* AI Code Generation Engine: Transforms visual workflows and English instructions into production-ready Rust and ink! code
* Specialized Polkadot IDE: Complete development environment tailored for Polkadot
* Deployment Pipeline: Streamlined process for deploying to Polkadot network

 Development Approach:
#### The platform is being built as a "user-friendly playground" that unifies code generation, deployment workflows, and collaborative tooling within a single interface. It aims to support rapid MVP development through automated code generation, visual flowcharts, and guided workflows to make Polkadot development accessible even to users with minimal Rust or blockchain experience


[![Development Playground](https://github.com/MasteraSnackin/PolkaVison/blob/main/doc/Screenshot%202025-04-21%20235657.png)](https://github.com/MasteraSnackin/PolkaVison/blob/main/doc/Screenshot%202025-04-21%20235657.png)



---
      Any PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

The FlowCode concept aims to transform Polkadot development by creating a visual AI tool that converts natural language into functional code.

I learned about this at the Easy Polkadot London Hackathon 2025.

Polkadot Deployment Portal (PDP) Initiative
The Polkadot Deployment Portal (PDP) represents another significant development addressing similar developer experience challenges:
"The Polkadot Deployment Portal (PDP), launching soon, will revolutionize how you deploy on Polkadot. Anyone will be able to take advantage of the PDP's intuitive UI and capabilities, allowing you to configure, deploy, and manage a rollup with a few simple clicks."

[Polkadot Deployment Portal:]([https://grants.web3.foundation/applications/project_aurras_mvp_phase_1](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/forum/t/polkadot-deployment-portal-the-1-click-solution-for-polkadot/12176))

Project Aurras developed an MVP for a middleware solution that acts as an event processor and workflow orchestration platform:
"Aurras is a middleware that acts as an event processor and a low-code workflow orchestration platform. Aurras is being pitched as a next-generation system for enabling decentralized push notifications."

While not directly focused on visual programming, this MVP demonstrates successful implementation of low-code workflow orchestration in the Polkadot ecosystem, which shares conceptual similarities with *PolkaVision's* visual workflow builder.

While there isn't a direct precedent for a visual, AI-powered Polkadot development tool exactly matching PolkaVision's description, several related initiatives demonstrate both the need and technical feasibility of such a solution.

The existing PoCs and MVPs in the ecosystem provide valuable insights for *PolkaVision's* development path‚Äîparticularly regarding rapid prototyping capabilities, security considerations, and approaches to lowering the barrier to entry for blockchain development.

[Project Aurras](https://grants.web3.foundation/applications/project_aurras_mvp_phase_1)


Chainziz, Submap, DotAppstore, etc.	Visualization, analytics, and app directories that make navigating and understanding the ecosystem easier for developers and users.

Polkadot.js & Substrate	Core tools and frameworks that simplify interaction and development on Polkadot, including user-friendly interfaces and modular blockchain building blocks.	Tooling and development frameworks

I used this to build EchoPay 2
      
### Drawing on what we learn from EchoPay 2
[EchoPay 2](https://github.com/YanniWu88/EchoPay-2/tree/master "EchoPay 2")

EchoPay 2 is an innovative payment platform concept enabling users to conduct secure, cross-chain transactions through voice commands. This repository contains the initial proof-of-concept implementation focusing on the frontend interface, wallet connection, and voice input simulation.

Key takeaway would be connection wallet, voice input simultation and write smart contract on rust, we use connect wallet to charge for AI credits.

### 1. User Model:

---
        What your project is not or will not provide or implement

What the Project Will Not Provide:

Excluded Features & Limitations
1. **Low-Level Programming Support**
‚ùå No assembly or manual Rust optimization
FlowCode avoids exposing users to low-level Rust/ink! coding, memory management, or performance tweaking. It abstracts these details behind its visual interface and AI-generated code.

2. **Multi-Chain Compatibility**
‚ùå No support for non-Polkadot ecosystems
The tool is strictly focused on Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama. Cross-chain compatibility with Ethereum, Solana, or other ecosystems is outside its scope.

3. **Advanced Infrastructure Management**
‚ùå No direct control over collators, validators, or RPC nodes
FlowCode relies on integrations like the Polkadot Deployment Portal (PDP) for infrastructure orchestration. It does not manage relay chain validators or coretime allocation directly.

4. **Custom Runtime Development**
‚ùå No manual runtime pallet configuration
Users cannot directly modify Substrate pallets or runtime logic. All runtime templates (e.g., OZ Generic/EVM) are pre-defined and managed via AI.

5. **On-Chain Governance Tools**
‚ùå No native governance dashboards
While FlowCode generates governance-related modules (e.g., voting systems), it does not provide tools for managing on-chain treasury proposals or council elections.

6. **Financial Services**
‚ùå No built-in wallets or payment gateways
FlowCode focuses on dApp development, not financial infrastructure. Users must integrate third-party wallets (e.g., Talisman, Polkadot.js).

7. **Manual Error Handling**
‚ùå No fine-grained exception control
The AI automatically handles common errors (e.g., transaction failures), avoiding low-level try/catch logic or manual rollback workflows.

8. **Legacy System Integration**
‚ùå No support for non-containerized environments
FlowCode mandates Docker-based workflows and pre-configured environments. It does not support legacy systems or custom non-containerized setups.

9. **Native Mobile Development**
‚ùå No mobile SDKs or platform-specific tooling
The platform generates web-first code (React/TypeScript) and does not target iOS/Android native apps.

10. **Proprietary AI Models for Code Audits**
‚ùå No manual AI model training
Users cannot customize or retrain the underlying AI models (e.g., Llama3Instruct8B) used for code generation or security audits.

Philosophical Exclusions
**No "code-first" workflows:** FlowCode prioritizes visual design over traditional coding, even for advanced users.

**No permissionless runtime modifications:** All deployments adhere to pre-vetted Polkadot runtime standards to ensure security.

**No community-driven template submissions:** Templates are curated internally to maintain quality and compatibility.

        If so, how is your project different?
How Polkavision Is Different
1. No-Code/Low-Code Development
Polkavision enables users to build and deploy on Polkadot without writing or understanding Rust (or even much code at all).

   Others like PDP focus on simplifying deployment, but often still require some technical configuration or scripting knowledge.

2. Unified Visual Interface
Polkavision offers a visual, drag-and-drop interface for designing parachains, smart contracts, and dApps.

    PDP and similar tools may provide step-by-step wizards or forms, but not a fully interactive visual builder.

3. End-to-End Workflow Integration
Polkavision covers the entire process: from design, deployment, monitoring, to upgrades‚Äîwithin a single platform.

    Other tools often focus on one aspect (e.g., deployment or monitoring), requiring users to switch between multiple platforms.

4. Accessibility for Non-Technical Users
Polkavision is designed specifically for entrepreneurs, product managers, and non-developers, not just software engineers.

    Most alternatives are still developer-centric, assuming some familiarity with blockchain concepts or coding.

5. Plug-and-Play Modules
    Polkavision provides a library of pre-built modules (governance, tokens, NFTs, etc.) that can be added with a click.

Other platforms may require manual configuration or code customization for similar features.

6. Real-Time Collaboration
    Polkavision supports collaborative editing, so teams can work together in real time‚Äîsimilar to Google Docs, but for blockchain projects.

Few, if any, competitors offer this level of real-time, multi-user collaboration.


Polkavision is unique because it:

- Dramatically lowers the technical barrier with a true no-code/low-code, visual approach.

- Provides an all-in-one platform covering every stage of the Polkadot development lifecycle.

- Is built for non-developers as well as developers, democratizing access to Polkadot‚Äôs technology.

- If you‚Äôre looking for the easiest, most accessible way to build on Polkadot‚ÄîPolkavision is designed for you.

## Key Takeaways

- **Polkavision** is the only platform offering a true no-code, visual, and collaborative experience for the entire Polkadot development lifecycle.
- **PDP** simplifies deployment but still requires some technical knowledge and lacks a visual builder or collaboration features.
- **Other tools** are powerful but developer-focused, with steep learning curves and fragmented workflows.
